Small modifications to run with gcc 4.3.4 (g++ and gfortran). Now it is necessary additionaly to compile LAPACK and F2CLIB. See COMPILE for instructions.

Modified 8 Jan 2005.

TDLIB'00+
=========

This is TDLIB'00+, an updated version of TDLIB'00. I have fixed the
code and now it can be compiled with gcc 3.3, at least on my Mac.

Note that my new e-mail is Evgenii@Rudnyi.Ru and the new TDLIB site is
at http://Evgenii.Rudnyi.Ru/programming.html#tdlib. The old e-mail and
the site mentioned in the code may not work.

Files
-----

doc/00tdlib.pdf is the manual.

lib/ contains the code. See README in this directory how to compile
TDLIB. You need to have LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/).

bin/ and include/ are empty directories for libraries and headers.

ex/ contains the examples from the manual. See README in this
directory. You need to compile assess to run the examples.

Learning Path
-------------

1) Browse the manual to see if this what you need.

2) Compile access. If you have gcc, chances are good that make will
work smoothly. If you have problems, contact me at Evgenii@Rudnyi.Ru.

3) Run examples according to the manual.

4) Develop your own application based on TDLIB.
