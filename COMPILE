I have tested this distribution with gcc 4.3.4 (g++ + gfortran)

1) Compile LAPACK

$ wget http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-3.3.0.tgz
$ tar zxvf lapack-3.3.0.tgz
$ cp INSTALL/make.inc.gfortran make.inc
$ make blaslib
$ make lapacklib
$ ls *.a
blas_LINUX.a  lapack_LINUX.a

Rename the libraries as libblas.a and liblapack.a and put in bin directory.

You do not need the optimized BLAS to work with TDLIB. The reference BLAS from LAPACK should be oktay.

2a) If you use g2c then change in make.ini

F77 = gfortran

to 

F77 = g2c

and then
 
G2C = -lf2c -lgfortran

to 

G2C = -lg2c

2b) If you gfortran, you need also to compile libf2c.a

$ wget http://www.netlib.org/f2c/libf2c.zip
$ unzip libf2c.zip

If you work under Cygwin, then edit makefile.u. Change a.out to a.exe two times.

$ make -f makefile.u

Copy the library libf2c.a to the bin directory.

3) Run make in lib and if all goes well you should obtain assess.exe in bin.
