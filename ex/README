TDLIB'00+ examples
==================

The directory contains files described in Section 3 of the TDLIB manual.

You need to compile assess first.

Example files looks much better if you editor support syntax coloring
(choose HTML or SGML).

If you use VIM, in order to turn on syntax highlighting for the mod files 
add the next line to .vimrc.

au BufNewFile,BufRead *.mod             set ft=sgml
