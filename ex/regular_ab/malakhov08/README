The goal of the file fig2.mod is to demonstrate, how one could make the Fig 2 from

Dmitri V. Malakhov, Thevika Balakumar
Undulate phase boundaries on binary T-x diagrams
Computer Coupling of Phase Diagrams and Thermochemistry 32 (2008) 89-93

with TDLIB (http://evgenii.rudnyi.ru/doc/misc/tdlib.html).

The command

assess fig2 -o out

produces file out.pd in the Gnuplot format. With the command

gnuplot out.pd -

one can visualize the plot. Finally

gnuplot plot

produces fig2.png.
