This bundle contains a linear programming package based on the dual
simplex method. The original code was given in Collected Algorithms
from CACM (1968) in algol 60 by Rudolfo Salazar and Subrata Sen. The
evaluators of this algorithm suggested some fixes that have also been
incorporated.
I translated it into C and have been using it for sometime now without
any problems. The code consists of two parts:

(1) A function called minit_space_handler to initialize arrays by
    mallocing the appropriate amount of space, and minit, the actual
    LP solver. These routines can be invoked directly by another
    package. Both are in file minit.c

(2) A front end to use the minit routines stand alone. Usage is
    documented in the man page.
    
If a laser printer is available, the man page may be printed as
  eqn minit.1 | troff -t -man | lpr -t -Pwhatever
Otherwise
  nroff -man minit.1

The implementation has been tested on a VAX 750 under BSD 4.2/4.3
and Sun-3's with OS 3.5 and 4.0.3.
