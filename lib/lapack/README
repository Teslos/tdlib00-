TDLIB uses LAPACK. This header is written by me to simplify Lapack
calls. TDLIB does not call functions in extern "C" directly. 
If you have problem with linking to your Lapack you can modify this.

The optimized BLAS is not crucial for TDLIB as it uses LAPACK not that
often and for relatively low-dimensional matrices. Well, clearly the
optimized BLAS is better.

ex/ contains some examples to call LAPACK
